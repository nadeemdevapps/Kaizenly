// Screenshot library — categorised by the ACTUAL on-screen content of each file.
//
// NOTE: the raw filenames are NOT reliable (several were shuffled/mislabelled
// when the library was captured). Every entry below was verified by visually
// inspecting the image, so `file` names may not match their alt text — that is
// expected. Do not "fix" a name to match its alt; the alt describes the truth.
//
// Privacy handling:
//  - 46 & 47 contained a visible Google account email -> shipped as MASKED copies.
//  - 48 (Drive restore progress) also showed the email and is intentionally EXCLUDED.
//
// Files intentionally NOT published (duplicates / near-identical variants):
//  17, 22, 23, 26, 28, 32, 34.
